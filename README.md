# Multimodal Detection of Coordinated Misinformation Campaigns

## Overview

This repository implements the research presented in "Multimodal Detection of Coordinated Misinformation Campaigns: Analyzing Text-Image Relationships in Social Media Using Large Language Models" by Dr. Fredrick Ateya (February 2025).

The system uses a novel approach to detect coordinated misinformation campaigns through the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with multimodal content analysis. It addresses critical challenges in identifying sophisticated misinformation campaigns that leverage both textual and visual content across multiple social media platforms.

## Key Features

- **Multimodal Analysis**: Combines text and image analysis to detect semantic inconsistencies between modalities
- **Coordination Detection**: Uses graph neural networks to identify patterns of coordinated content sharing
- **Cross-Platform Analysis**: Capable of tracking content evolution across multiple social media platforms
- **Real-Time Processing**: Optimized for high-throughput processing of social media content
- **High Accuracy**: Achieves 92.3% accuracy in identifying coordinated misinformation campaigns

## System Architecture

The system consists of several key components:

1. **Text Encoder**: Leverages BERT to process textual content
2. **Image Encoder**: Uses Vision Transformer (ViT) for image analysis
3. **Cross-Modal Attention**: Analyzes relationships between text and images
4. **Fusion Module**: Combines features from both modalities
5. **Coordination Detector**: Graph neural network that identifies coordinated campaigns
6. **Real-Time Processing Pipeline**: Handles high-volume content streams

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch 2.0+
- Transformers 4.30.0+
- PyTorch Geometric
- Pillow
- NetworkX
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/misinformation-detection.git
cd misinformation-detection

# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Dataset Preparation

The system requires a dataset with the following structure:

```
data/
├── images/
│   ├── image_1.jpg
│   ├── image_2.jpg
│   └── ...
├── train_metadata.json
├── val_metadata.json
└── test_metadata.json
```

Each metadata file should contain a list of samples with text, image filename, and labels.

For demonstration purposes, the system includes a synthetic dataset generator:

```python
from config import Config
from data_utils import generate_synthetic_dataset

config = Config()
generate_synthetic_dataset(config, num_samples=5000)
```

### Training

To train the misinformation detection system:

```python
from system import CampaignDetectionSystem

# Initialize the system
config = Config()
system = CampaignDetectionSystem(config)

# Prepare data loaders
train_loader, val_loader, test_loader = system.prepare_data_loaders()

# Train the model
system.train(train_loader, val_loader)
```

### Evaluation

To evaluate the trained model:

```python
# Evaluate on test set
metrics = system.evaluate(test_loader)
print(f"Accuracy: {metrics['accuracy']:.4f}")
print(f"F1 Score: {metrics['f1']:.4f}")
```

### Real-Time Processing

For real-time processing of content streams:

```python
from data_utils import create_stream_simulation

# Create a simulated stream
stream_loader, rate, duration = create_stream_simulation(
    config, samples_per_minute=5000, duration_minutes=1
)

# Process the stream
results = system.process_real_time_stream(
    stream_loader, max_posts=rate * duration
)

# Access results
misinformation_posts = results['misinformation_posts']
coordination_clusters = results['coordination_clusters']
```

### Visualizing Coordination Networks

To visualize detected coordination patterns:

```python
# Extract features from posts
features_list = [...]  # List of feature tensors
metadata_list = [...]  # List of post metadata

# Generate visualization
graph = system.visualize_coordination_network(features_list, metadata_list)
```

## Performance Metrics

The system achieves the following performance metrics:

- Misinformation Detection Accuracy: 92.3%
- Precision: 90.8%
- Recall: 91.5%
- F1 Score: 91.1%
- Processing Rate: 5,000 posts per minute
- Response Time: 200ms per post

## Case Studies

The system has been validated through several case studies:

1. **Health Misinformation Campaign**: 95.2% accuracy, 180-second response time
2. **Election Disinformation**: 93.8% accuracy, 150-second response time
3. **Climate Change Misinformation**: 91.5% accuracy, 220-second response time
4. **Financial Scam Detection**: 94.7% accuracy, 160-second response time
